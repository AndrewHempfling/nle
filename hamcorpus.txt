WOW! This is mouth watering delicious!**Line the pan with a LOT of foil** You will have a honey of a mess if you don't.I used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup. Cut the recipe in 1/2 or you will have a ton of glaze. I used a spiral 17 lb. ham & still had glaze eventhough I cut the recipe in 1/2.. Can't go wrong with this recipe. Just use plenty of FOIL!!!!!!!We made this for Christmas.  Very good Turned out great!  We put the ham & glaze in an oven bag and just flipped the bag every 15-20min instead of basting.1/3 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey  baby carrots underneath , crock pot, lift lid and baste often, stud ham with clovesI'm not the biggest ham fan- but it was great!  It was a big holiday hit with my whole family. I added the juice from a can of pineapple rings to the sauce and then for the last 10 minutes of baking I garnished the ham with the pineapple rings.  Beautiful and tasty!!Loved, loved, loved this ham!!!!  First time I ever made a ham.(had to ask other shoppers what to buy...shank or butt? Shank won!)  Excellent recipe even though I used brown sugar instead of the syrup and omitted the cloves(hate cloves..yuk). Will definetly make this again!This make a great presentation ham, just like the picture.  Luckily the baste does make a lot because we could not reuse anything that cooked off because the honey separated under the aluminum foil and the butter remained on top (baked honey is a lot of fun to clean).   My husband and I have never made a ham before so we had to do some reasearch to what "score" means.  To score a ham means to cut diagonally at 1" intervals, cutting about 1/4" deep.  (score in opposite direction to make a diamond shape.) This made a great dinner ham but we didn't care for the flavor when used as leftovers for sandwiches.Came out great! I used an 8lb spiral cut ham. I used 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1 cup of honey and just a few cloves for the glaze based on previous reviews. I used most of it, but kept a little for the end.  I used an oven bag and flipped it over every 15-20 minutes to baste, it ended up breaking towards the end. At the end I took off the bag, brushed with a little more glaze I had not used, and put some brown sugar all over the ham, then broiled it on low for about 3 minutes for the crispy sugar layer the fancy pre-made hams come with. Watch the broiler it crisps fast. I followed the cooking instructions from the ham since it was precooked spiral cut, and cooked it on 275 for 10 minutes per lb to prevent drying out and it came out juicy and delicious. I served with cheesy potatoes and honey & brown sugar carrots cooked in the glaze.This is as close to the honey baked ham that I have found. The only thing that was missing was the crunchy topping so after I basted and cooked the ham, I put brown sugar on top and broiled it for about 2 to 3 minutes you just have to watch it so that it will not burn.Better than the famous honey baked ham at the store. I have some good tips! I used an ordinary Kirkland spiral ham from Costco...about 8 pounds. I think buying a spiral ham is key because all the glaze can get into the slices. I don't score it. I take the cold ham and pull the slices open, one at a time and pour the warm glaze into the meat.  I flip it over and do the same to the other side of the slices.  Then I put the ham meat side down on the pan and do another pour of the glaze over the whole ham.  I bake mine at 275 for 12 to 15 per pound.  I find that baking at this lower temperature makes it much more moist!  I do baste, but not as often as the recipe calls for-I'm too busy and I don't use a brush -just pour glaze on the ham w/ ladle. When the ham comes out, and as it rests a bit, I take a turkey baster and suck up all the hot ham juices/honey/sugar from the baking pan and start basting all the slices again as it cools!! It sucks up all the yumminess like you wouldn't believe. I carve it up and place the slices on a big plate and for good measure, pour a little bit of the pan juices over the slices. I found that the amount of glaze this recipe makes was enough for an 8 pound ham. I also used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup like the others mentioned.  I did't have whole cloves, so I put a tiny pinch of ground cloves in the sauce (but a very small pinch since it's strong). Didn't do double boiler, but kept on stove and heated it only as needed, mostly stove's off.My first attempt at a ham.  My kids were skeptical when I told them I was making a ham, as we're not big ham eaters.  I used a bone in spiral cut smoked ham from Costco, 9lbs. I used 2/3c butter, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4c brown sugar and 1c honey. Placed in crockpot for 6 hrs on low and basted every 30mins.  Added baby carrots after 3 hrs.  This glaze is AMAZING! The carrots were delicious and the ham was awesome!  My kids were happily suprised and I received many many compliments.  Will definitely make this for years to come!REALLY good glaze. The husband was so worried about me trying my own glaze instead of using a pre-glazed ham but one bite was all it took to calm his fears. I got a spiral cut ham and this made a delicious, light glaze that was wonderful on the outside but not so strong that it overpowered the meat. 
Followed reviewer's advice to use brown sugar instead of corn syrup and put the ham in an oven bag for easier glazing and clean up. WOW!I wish I could add more stars to my review because this ham turned out great!  
I used a 9-1/2 lb butt portion ham that was not fully cooked.  I cooked it for two hours with just a little water and pineapple juice in a pan tented with foil.  I was using a meat thermometer, so once the temp reached about 100 degrees, I glazed it and let it cook until it reached 140 degrees.  
I halved the recipe for the glaze and it was more than enough for the ham.  I also used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup.  I didn't broil it at the end and I kept the foil on it for the entire cooking time so it didn't dry out.
I can't believe how good this ham tasted.  Our guests were taking samples as my husband was slicing it for the dinner.  I'll never again buy a honey-baked ham for the $50 or whatever it is they charge!I read the reviews & this ham sounded wonderful, so I made it for the Holidays. The flavor was delicious. My 7-lb ham was literally covered in cloves & I still had about an 1/8 cup left, so you don't really need that much. Also, 1 hour & 15 minutes is way too long if you have a spiral sliced ham, as it got a little dry through the 1st 5 or 6 layers, but the glazed soaked in really nice & so it still had a wonderful flavor.
It does make a lot of glaze, but we saved it for the left overs & re-heated it serving it in little ramekins to dip ham pieces in as you would au jus, & that made it fun & yummier.
I think I might try cooking the glaze down a bit next time to get a thicker & less runny consistency so that I can cook the ham for a shorter period. Thinking 45 minutes would do fine for spiral cut & 1 hour for non cut for a moister ham. The orange juice idea also sounded tempting, so might also try adding that the next time. All & all though, this is an excellent base recipe with room for personal touches. Mahalo Colleen! (Thank You)This is a recipe that must be altered to your taste preference and based on the size of your ham. I used brown sugar in place of the corn syrup and used ground cloves rather than whole. Baste regularly and it turns out lovely every time.This is so good, make sure you keep the sauce warm for basting, I use a mini crock pot to keep it warm.Hints:  This is the 10th time I've made this ham.   I put about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice in the glaze and ground cloves instead of studding the whole ham.  This is just another variation.  We have 3 little ones, so they don't like pulling out cloves!
Best ham I've ever made.  Just wonderful taste.  I also put a little ground clove in the glaze for added flavor. Some pointers:  Seriously, really line the pan with aluminum foil.  I only put a flimsy piece in, and the glaze got underneath, and burned into this immovable glob of gunk.  I traded pans halfway through the cooking.  The ham was still the best though!  I just had to throw out the pan!Due to having a diebetic in the house we used 2 cups of agave nectar in place of the honey and only used 2 tablespoons of cornsyrup.  We didn't tell anyone we made the switch and got rave reviews and our diebetic got to have "honey glazed ham".  Hope this helps those who have health issues.My Easter ham came out great. The only complaints I might have is that I had a TON of the glaze leftover. Also, make sure you have a GREAT basting brush. The glaze is quite thick and you'll end up with hairs on your ham if you use a ratty old brush.Do you remove the skin before cooking and adding the glaze or do you leave the skin on?I thought this was excellent with just a few changes for personal preference. First, I use brown sugar instead of corn syrup. Second, I use 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves in place of whole cloves. And lastly, I cut down on the amount of the other ingredients. So for me, I mix together 1/3 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg. I'm not a fan of cooking bags (just personal preference), so I triple line a 9X13 pan with foil and baste every 15 minutes. Super yummy! No more expensive honey baked hams for me!This is a fantastic glaze! I followed other reviewers advice and cut the honey in half, substituted brown sugar for the corn syrup and used 1 tsp ground cloves as I had a spiral sliced ham. This made just enough glaze to do a 11 1/2 lb ham. wonderful!!! Thanks for sharing!very good recipe! I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and added some pineapple juice.I used 1/2C brown sugar instead of corn syrup, 3/4C butter, and only 1C honey (no cloves) - and it was more than enough to coat and baste my 7 lb, pre-sliced ham with a bit left over. I rubbed on some brown sugar with about 10 minutes' baking time left...turned out delicious! The leftover meat was refrigerated with the leftover glaze, which left it moist and flavorful. Mmmm! Will likely use this recipe again for Christmas. :)I used this recipe for the ham I cooked on Christmas.  It was DELICIOUS! I used brown sugar instead of corn syrup as well. I poured the glaze on for the first time after 20 minutes of being in the oven, and basted every 15 after that.  At the end, I sprinkled raw dark brown sugar on the top of the ham and turned on the broiler to make a crunchy glaze.  Wonderful.I have made this twice now.  And each time my ham turns out wonderful!  Everyone tells me its the best ham they have ever had.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Definitely a keeper.Outstanding--better than the Honey Baked Ham Company brand.  I did tweak the recipe but only slightly.  I used a spiral ham.  Made the glaze using 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of whole cloves and corn syrup.  You will not believe how good this tastes!!!I made this for a dinner party and just bought a basic Tyson spiral cut ham (1.79/lb) from the grocery store.  I found this recipe, and didnt want to make a 3rd trip to the store, so like many others I used brown sugar instead of the syrup and put the sauce on low on the stove, then turned off and let the oven heat keep the sauce warm while the ham cooked and I basted.  I also covered the ham with foil to keep it from drying out and the whole thing turned out really good.  Of course, how could brown sugar, butter, and honey not be good?  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.Love, love, love this. Thanks for sharing :)I made this for easter, I was a bit worried because I usally buy a Honey Baked ham.  I changed the receipe a bit using brown sugar instead of corn syrup.  I also followed the baking instructions that came with my store bought- sprial sliced ham, which were to bake it at 225 degrees for two hours (1/2 ham).  Put the sliced side down and put foil over it while baking.  It was every bit as good as Honey Baked and half the cost.!!!! Thanks for the receipe.This glaze definitely delivered!  I had bought the honey baked ham before and was hoping to replicate it at home, and this recipe definitely got the job done!  I am providing many details about what I did because I had never made a ham before and had to research a bit to figure out what to do to actually put this meal together. We bought a pre-cooked spiral-sliced, bone-in ham (about 7 lbs), and followed the  directions on the package (put baby carrots, 1 can of pineapple juice, and the ham face-down in a foil lined roasting pan and baked at 325 degrees, 15 minutes of cooking per pound).  I modified the recipe for the glaze as other reviewers have noted and halved it and we still had plenty of glaze- I heated 1 cup honey, 2 tbsp Dark Corn Syrup, 2 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and 1 tsp ground cloves in a saucepan on very low heat (as I didn't have a double-boiler).  I then used a silicone baster brush to baste the ham every 15 minutes.  After the last basting, I reduced the rest of the glaze by turning the heat up in the saucepan and stirring continuously until it thickened.  Then, 5 minutes before I planned to take the ham out of the oven I poured the thickened glaze over the ham and took the lid off of the roasting pan to broil the ham.  It came out so delicious, both the ham and the carrots were juicy and flavorful.  I will definitely make this easy recipe again!  Don't forget to Baste, Baste, Baste! Me and my husband are still eating the delicious leftovers!Fantastic! I love Honey-Baked ham but not the price you have to pay for them. I decided to try this. Pretty bold since I was having 22 people for dinner. It was a huge hit! I bought a 7 lb pre-cooked spiral ham for this recipe. I like many others used brown sugar and only 1 cup of honey because that is all I had. 
The glaze was not sticky like others said, nor did I have to keep it warm until I had used it all. I did use heavy duty aluminum foil and was glad I did. It leaked out a bit but was not hard to clean at all. I will make this many more times. It is a definite keeper! Thanks so much for sharing.Made this recipe for Easter (and am making it again today).  I used a spiral cut ham, brown sugar instead of corn syrup, and half the honey.  Everyone loved it.We loved this ham!  I used 1/3 cup of butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup of honey as suggested by other reviewers.  I will definitely be making this again!This is excellent as is, or can easily be tweaked to met your family's tastes. Using an oven bag and flipping and turning it is far easier than basting, and clean up is easier, too.
NOTE: for those who miss the crispy crust of the true HoneyBaked - please know that they use a blowtorch or other hi-temp device to turn their glaze into the crispy crust you so admire!  You can do the same thing at home - save a small amount of your glaze, and thicken it with brown sugar.  It should resemble a wet paste.  Spread over your ham at the END of its' cooking time.  It should NOT run off, but should cover the ham surface.  Turn on your broiler and allow to preheat.  Slide ham under, and WATCH CAREFULLY!  When you get a nice bubbly surface, remove from heat.  Allow to cool and VOILA - a crisp crusted HOMEYbaked Ham.  :-)The best ham I ever tasted!  My parents get ham every Christmas from the Honey Baked Company and I have to admit, this recipe's taste exceeds their's.
I substitute the dark corn syrup for brown sugar, since I prefer that taste instead.
One thing I have learned-
I baked a 12 pound ham and I didn't need the extra ingredients.  I would have save using the set proportions for the (5 pound) rather than use the Servings calculation.  Next time, I will start with smaller ingredient portions since it is used in the basting only.  
Try this!  You will love it!Easy to make and was quite tasty.  I used an oven bag for easier cleanup.I used this recipe to make my first holiday meal for my family.  It turned out excellent.  The taste is amazingly sweet and the recipe is easy to do while cooking other items.  Only thing I would change next time would be to not sear it under the broiler at the end.  It was perfect without, and burned a bit with.This was wonderful!  I had never made a ham with glaze before & I was a little worried, but it went over really well with my "pickies".  I too cut the honey in half & used brown sugar, I didn't have whole cloves, so I put 1 tsp. of ground cloves into the glaze. We put on the grill & it turned out perfect.  Thanks much Colleen!Aug 1/11 ~ Did this again but  for the first time tried it on the grill. It was absolutely delicious. I put it on my gas grill using indirect heat and maintained the temperature between 250* and 275* glazing every 15 minutes. I had it on about 1 1/2 ~ 2 hours.  This time I served it with Emily's Famous Hashbrowns (this site) and sauteed cabbage.
We throughly enjoyed this tonight with scalloped potatoes and veggies.  A real winner!  I will be using some of the leftovers in baked beans and can hardly wait! Thank you for sharing, delicious!Incredible!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Out of necessity, I changed the karo syrup to brown sugar and I only had a 1 3/4 cup honey and used enough cloves for looks rather than measuring.  Everything else was the same and the ham was so amazing.  My spiral ham was twice the size, 10# but I kept the liquid the same and had plenty.  I tented foil over the ham loosely so it wouldn't dry out and doubled the cooking time per package on ham.  I also cooked the ham on it's side rather than flat side down which is how I normally do it.  Half way through cooking, I flipped the ham and I'm glad I did.  The bottom was soggy from juice but an hour of basting it gave it a nice layer of crispness too.  Basting is key.  Also, I have a gas oven and turned the broiler on high for the last 5 minutes leaving some blackened bits of ham and smokiness in my oven. Next time, I'll broil on low.  All in all a tremendous success and the best have I've ever made!This is a very good basic ham glaze.  It is not a substitute for the famous store-bought variety though--it has too much liquid to form a coating, even though I did substitute brown sugar for the syrup.  But, it's still very good.  Definitely half this recipe; I did (after reading these reviews) and still had leftovers.This is an excellent recipe.  I bought a 13 lb. smoked semi-boneless ham and didn't change the amount of glaze, because I figured I'd have enough.  I did and actually put the leftover glaze in a gravy boat for those who wanted it.  I also used brown sugar instead of corn syrup.  I didn't score the ham, but put ground cloves in the glaze.  I tented the ham with foil and basted about every 15-20 minutes and then broiled for only about 3 minutes (low broil) at the very end.  The broiling put a beautiful color on it.  This ham was so juicy and tasty - I have never had as many compliments.  Considering that my ham cost about $11.00, I'm never buying Honeybaked again.I made this for thanksgiving and it was the best. I had picked up crushed cloves instead of whole cloves by accident and was too scared to use it, afraid that i would use too much so I decided not to use it at all and this was by far the best ham I have ever eaten!  Thank you so much!  I did use a spiral sliced ham and there is no way to tell the difference between this one and the famous honeybaked hams!  WONDERFUL!well i made it it came out good but here the problem 2 cups of honey cost $12 and hame cost $ 22 and other ingredient $13  if you buy the honey bake hame its like $ 52 and its done worth paying $6 dollar more to have it doneI have had the famous honey baked hams before. I like them but trust me, this recipe is just as good, if not better. Plus you save money! I have used whole cloves and sometimes add ground cloves to the honey mixture and baste on. Either way, it's good. I also use dark brown sugar in lieu of the corn syrup and increase the honey a bit. I think it makes for a better tasting ham. After taking my ham out of the fridge, I brush on some of the glaze and let it sit out for about 60 mins before baking. That way the inside of the ham won't be cold and the outside hot.I used 1/4 c. of brown sugar instead of the corn syrup, I covered the ham with the cloves, pineapple slices and maraschino cherries, and I added a little bit of the pineapple juice to the glaze.
Everyone loved it. I will use this recipe everytime I make ham. Thank you!This was amazing. I made a 13 pound ham for Easter and it was a HUGE hit! I bought a very cheap and basic ham, too. I followed other reviews and used and oven bag. AMAZING. It was so easy that I may make more ham when it goes on sale. I scored it all over. I used 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 2/3 cup butter. I flipped the bag every 15 minutes and cooked it for about an hour. I say it again... AMAZING! And, I have never done a ham before.I am a mother of 2 small children, so when I saw the slowcooker adaptation that MAZZO did for this recipe, I leapt at the idea of 'taking the easy way out'. The added bonus of their adaptation was the honey glazed carrots. I was very disappointed with this recipe done in the slowcooker with the addition of baby carrots. I found that neither the ham nor the carrots really got a strong flavour. I decided this recipe deserved fair shake so I prepared it as written and surprise-surprise, it was oodles better. Since I still really wanted to accompany this recipe with honey glazed carrots, after the ham came out of the oven, I poured the remaining glaze into a small sauce pan with a small bag of baby carrots and boiled them together for 8-10ish minutes. The carrots were a dream. Thank you, MAZZO, for suggesting the addition of carrots, but when I make this recipe again, I will stick to the original and prepare my carrots as a seperate dish :)I had a 9 lb precooked spiral cut ham and used 1 cup of butter, 1.5 cups of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 2 cups of honey. I cooked the glaze and basted the ham with half of it prior to cooking. While cooking (I covered the ham with aluminum foil) I basted every 10-15 minutes and used up the rest of the glaze. I let it cook uncovered towards the end for about 10 minutes, then I broiled the ham for about 3 minutes, took it out of the oven, let it cool a bit. Then I rubbed brown sugar over the top and broiled it for 2 more minute. Delicious! The only thing that was missing was pineapple slices. I'll add that next time.Fantastic.  It is now my christmas ham. Go easy on the cloves though unless you're big into cloves.This is so simple and soooooo good! My wife is not a big ham fan but loves this recipe. I used the suggestion of using a oven bag, and I just flip it over every 15 mins or so. Also use brown sugar instead of corn syrup, it is simple delicious!Great recipe. I also used butter rather than corn syrup, and for extra flavour added the zest of an orange, a small amount (1/4 cup) of orange juice, a large dash of orange liquer (Cointreau) and a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. The foil tip is a good one - baked glaze is pan-ruiner !Delicious! I don't know how it compares to the Honey Baked Ham Brand cause i've never had it. However, this ham is the best i've had. I used a 5 pound spiral cut ham (see picture) and cut the glaze in half since most reviewers said it makes a lot of glaze. The amount was perfect and the ham turned out very flavorful. The cuts in the ham helped the glaze distribute.This ham was out of this world delicious. I did change it up somewhat... omitted the cloves,added 1/4 cup brown sugar, used just 1-1/2 cups of honey  and added a bit of 7-up.
Everybody ate like there's no tomorrow! Thank you.Good and easy!Great taste, everyone loved it.Baste often. I Make for Easter most years.   Makes a lot of sauce, can get away with half. Try in an oven bag turning over every 15 to 20 mins to baste.  Can use brown sugar instead of syrup.  this was one of the best hams I ever made. Think it was because I followed the cooking time,Mine was 11 pounds wasn't dry at all and such a nice flavor[.FYI ,most hams are pre cooked, average cooking time is 15 min per pound @325 degrees. Plan your cooking time,go low and slow,you'll be glad you didI used a crock pot liner and cooked it in the crock pot for several hours. It came out tasty and tender. Best ham I've ever made and it was loved by all.Very tasty and great consistency for basting!  Did cut the recipe in half for a 5.27 lb ham and the amount was just right.  Also cooked the ham on the grill using the slow cook/indirect heat method.  1) Added onion, garlic, cloves and misc. seasonings to water in drip pan; 2)Place ham cut side down over drip pan, cook for 1 hour; 3)Take ham off grill, score and stud with cloves; 4) Return ham to grill, place cut side down, baste with glaze, cook 15 minutes, baste and cook 15 minutes more; 5) Place roasting rack on grill over drip pan, stand ham up on it's side in roasting rack, baste with glaze; 6) Continue cooking and basting every 15-20 minutes, until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.  Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.  Came out fabulous!Absolutely the best, hands down, ham that my family has ever eaten. I did sub brown sugar for some of the corn syrup and mixed ground cloves in the glaze instead of studding the ham. Also used a bone in ham because we like to make soup. Awesome!Yumm!  I kept the exact recipe, but used a 8 lb. ham instead; so there was not extra sauce.  And used brown sugar in place of the syrup, like others have mentioned.  I also tented the ham for the first 60 minutes, and then left uncovered the last 20 minutes.Amazing, the best ham I have ever had! Used brown sugar as a substitute.great recipe .i have made it three times but used brown sugar and light karo syrup. alss added a touch of mustard for the bite .my family loves ot .this recipe is a keeperUse brown sugar instead of molasses.  When it's done, sprinkle brown sugar on top and broil on low for about 5-10 minutes.  This comes out just like the hams at Honey Baked Ham Company.  FantasticI've made this twice and both times gotten rave reviews from everyone... Here is what I do: get a cheap ham I use a 6-7 pound butt portion.  I use brown sugar instead of syrup, use 1/2 cup butter, use 1 1/2 - 2 cups honey and I have not had whole cloves so I just sprinkle a little ground cloves in the mix. I don't baste, just brush the sauce on 3 - 4 times during baking.Wonderful recipe.  I am going to be hard pressed to buy another honey glazed ham given the taste of this ham without the high cost.  I did cut the amount of glaze in half.  Also, I wrapped it is foil so that the ham wouln't dry out.So I've now made this twice... I used ground cloves in the mix both times, and pineapple juice in the honey mixture once. Both times it was a hit.. delicious!Juicy and tender, great flavor. I used a 6 lb. Bluegrass jubilee ham. Five hours on low in the crock pot, basting every 30-60 minutes, was perfect. Microwave the glaze - no need to mess with a double boiler.My mother and I made this ham today, and it was wonderfully delicious! I omitted the cloves and used light corn syrup instead of dark. My mom said this recipe was a keeper, and I agree! Thanks!This is a delicious recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving and again at Christmas (by family request).  Everyone has asked for my recipe - it is one to keep!  I did follow the suggestion to switch out the syrup for brown sugar.  The best rendition for me came by accident.  I cooked the ham in the oven for an hour, then moved it to a lined crockpot.  After driving an hour, I plugged in the crockpot and cooked on high for another hour and a half.  My glaze had cooled and become thick like paste.  I kept spreading it on as the crockpot cooked and it made the sugary finish that you see on the name-brand ham that you pay $100.  Very yummy!This is by far the best ham I have ever had.  I basted it often and generously.  When in the oven, I kept it loosely covered with aluminum foil to keep the ham from drying out and the glaze from burning.  For the last 5 minutes of cooking, I removed the foil and turned the broiler on to caramelize the glaze a bit.  It turned out wonderful.  Thanks!Everyone who tries this says it's the best ham they've ever had. I don't use all the cloves, maybe 1 tablespoon. Just dot the ham with cloves to your liking. A quarter cup was too much clove for me. I bake this as described using a spiral ham, then I cut the ham off the bone into a crockpot and add all the juices and leftover glaze. Just heat it up to serve it. I've served it fresh out of the oven with the glaze on the side, but I think it's much better served from the crockpot.
There is no need for foil in the pan. It cleans up much easier without the foil.Very good.  Tastes almost exactly like a purchased honey glazed ham.  I didn't bother with the entire amount of cloves as it would've taken me all day to insert them.  Still had good flavor and I didn't bother with turning on the broiler to carmelize.  Will make again.Excellent per other reviewers suggestions (omit cloves, sub brown sugar for corn syrup). Thanks :-)AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! This was just wonderful!! I bought a 2 pound ham because it was just me & my hubby, so I cut the recipe in half. I made exactly as the recipe called for except I used brown sugar in place of the corn syrup because I didn't have any on hand. Then I lined my pan really good with tin foil & put half the glaze in there while simmering the other half on the stove. I basted the ham often & when there was 10 min. left for the ham & half of the remaining glaze on the ham & then the rest of it when there was 5 min. left. There was a ton of glaze but it was sooo yummy that I didn't mind at all!! I served with mashed sweet potatoes, squash & honey wheat bread (from this site) The bread tasted soooo great dipped in the glaze!! My hubby loves ham & he thought this was absolutley great! I like ham but I don't usually have more than a piece or 2 & I thought it was the best ham I ever had period!!! I will be making this for christmas dinner when I have the family over! Awsome recipe, thanks soo much :)This was easy to do but not worth the time.  normally in our house ham is devoured but with this glaze no one even came back for seconds.  It was to bitter and to butter.  It was not the sweet honey taste I thought it would have.Too much butter and honey! It was not a pleasent smell or taste. I did not alter the recipe. I would suggest less butter, honey, no cloves, and using light brown sugar in sub for the syrup. The strange sweet flavor over powered this ham! If you have a presliced ham bake with a foil cover or yours will dry out too. I have never made a ham before and this came out perfect!  My hubby said it was the best ham he's ever eaten!  :)  I followed "Mazzo"'s review and used 1/3 C butter, 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/4 C honey for the glaze.  I also put some sliced carrots in the baking pan with the ham so they got some of that honey-sugary flavor too.  I don't even really like carrots but I ate them all.  YUM!!!!  Thanks, Colleen, for an awesome ham recipe I will be sure to use again and again!Very good and easy!Thank you for sharing this recipe ! It was delicious i did not vary from the original recipe. I used a regular ham from the grocery store to test the recipe, Everyone loved it. next time i will splurge and buy the spiral ham this is definently a keeper.I have been using this recipe from Colleen for years! Excellent flavor; you won't be disappointed! It has become a permanent recipe in my family's cookbook since the first day I tried it! Just as delicious as Honey Baked Ham Store!LOVED this recipe! I used a 7lb Cook's shank portion ham.  It turned out great! I followed the suggestions of many other reviewers and substituted the brown sugar for the corn syrup and used 1/4 tsp ground cloves instead of whole cloves. I cooked the ham for about an hour in 1 cup pineapple juice before glazing. Didn't need to broil because the glaze was a beautiful, rich, golden color after about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I forgot to half the recipe and had a ton of glaze left over. I used it to moisten my leftovers before storing and they stayed yummy and juicy for days!I have been looking for an easy ham glaze. Now I have found it!  I did make a few changes as other readers did.  I used 1/3 cup butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup honey, and 4 oz. pineapple juice.This was great but I didn't waste time studding with whole cloves just used ground.  Used small, cooked hamDelicious. This was my first ham ever. My whole family loved it, including the picky eaters. And the leftovers made great ham and  potato soup. It was somewhat hands on, but I will definitely make this again.Excellent! Made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and everybody loved it. Bought an 11 lb. spiral ham. I also used 1/4 c. brown sugar instead of syrup and added 1 T. lemon juice. Instead of lining the pan with foil, I used an oven bag and carefully turned the ham over every 15 minutes. Came out so juicy...this will become a family favorite. Happy cooking!I am new to this site but cannot stop now searching for recipes! Now everyone considers me a great chef but I don't work in a restaurant - only at home.  I made this on New Year's Day and it was fantastic and I don't even like ham at all but now I love it.  I used an electric roaeter oven - used organic honey - didn't have the syrup so followed the reviewers advice & also used foil under ham to keep from ruining my roaster.  Bought an uncooked ham (this was the first time I bought a ham & shopped on new year's eve so erred in my haste - I tried to avoid spiral hams & managed to do that.  I used the other recipe on this site due to it being raw for slow roasted ham (took about 5 or more hours) - 275 deg. and put honey & cloves on the ham b4 slow roasting.  Basted every hour -- then turned up the heat & followed this recipe for last hour & 1/2 +.  Made 10 lb ham.  It was the best ever - moist soft - better than honey baked ham store! It was just my husband and me but w/in 4 days we ate the whole ham! Used leftovers in lots of casserole & scalloped potatoes. I am making it for Easter tomorrow! can't waitOne of the best techniques for glazing ham anywhere. We had a 17 lb boneless and we followed the receipe to the letter. You have to baste every 15 minutes but it's not that big of a deal and the reward is WELL WORTH THE EFFORT! Boy oh boy, was this ever a big hit. People were saying that this was the best ham that they had ever eaten. THANKS COLLEEN for posting it on Allrecipies.Excellent!  I just made this for our Sunday lunch and it was amazing and super easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband kept picking at the ham after we were finished eating saying how amazing it was.  This will be my go to ham recipe!!This makes a delicious ham!  I had an 8-pound spiral cut ham and used 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 cup of honey and 2/3 cup butter.  It was not too sticky while basting, but the pan was a mess afterwards.  I'm thinking of getting a disposable pan to put inside our roasting pan next time, and then I could throw it out.I followed the various suggestions, using brown sugar, and ground cloves, and a smidge of pineapple juice.  I turned the scored side down,  cut slices down the top side, and basted every 18 minutes. This was the MOISTEST ham I have ever eaten, and hubby loved it!  I didnt have a fully cooked ham, so baked for 18 minutes per pound.  The amount of sauce in this recipe worked out perfectly for my 11.5 lb. ham.  EXCELLENT!, will definitely make again.What a wonderful recipe! I used a "butt portion" ham, bone-in, and had the most tender and juicy ham ever made. I have made many hams, but never one this delicious. Not too sweet, and not at all salty. I cooked mine cut side down. Perfection! So good I froze the leftover glaze for next time. The sweetness was a nice touch for the pea soup I made with the bone and *very little ham that was leftover. Thank you Colleen !I have been cooking for more years than I would like to admit....but this is the very best way to make ham!Don't follow the review for the crock pot. It will be dry! Next time, I will make it as directed.Wonderful recipe. I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone agreed this is the best ham they had ever tasted and my MIL has ordered up some very expensive hams in the past...this ham was far better than any of those.  I used a spiral cut ham that I purchased from my local grocery store...nothing special about it other than the cut, I doubled the recipe because I had a 14lb ham(will not double next time-too much) and substituted 1/2 tsp ground cloved for the whole cloves.  I cooked it in a foil pan so I didn't have to worry about clean up. I basted every 10 - 15 minutes and at 45 minutes the slices started falling open so I turned on the broiler and broiled for about 7 minutes...really watch it at this point because it will brown faster than you think.   Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I will be happily making this every Christmas as ordered by my MIL. Everyone loved it.....did I mention that there was barely any leftovers to send home? We only had 13 people here and 2 were under 8. YUM YUM YUM!!!!!Amazing! When I found this recipe here, I wanted to try it. My husband grew up on the bought honey ham from the store, and he was a little wary of this. No more! Now he brags to everyone about how I make a honey ham better than you can get from the grocers! Everyone who has tried it has absolutely love this ham, look no more for a better recipe! I cooked mine in the slow cooker on low, so it was nice and moist. However, next time I will put skewers in it, because since it was scored, the front piece fell over and became hard since it was it the glaze the whole time. I lined the slow-cooker with foil, (generously), sprayed it with pam, so clean up was a snap! I kept the glaze warm on the stove top...I didn't use a double boiler, but I sprayed the pot with veg. oil, melted the butter first- clean up wasn't a problem. I'm making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year!I myself am not much of a ham eater, but my mom who rarely compiments said it was excellent!! I purchased half a boneless ham at Christmas time and had the butcher cut it in dinner slices.  I made the glaze omitting the cloves and substituted brown sugar for the corn syrup.  I marinated it overnight, baked it for 20 minutes at 350 and it was delish!Delicious! I followed the suggestions and used 1/8cup brown sugar and 1/8cup light corn syrup (didnt have dark). I also halved the honey and butter. I didn't have cloves either and it was still amazing!WOW! This is mouth watering delicious!**Line the pan with a LOT of foil** You will have a honey of a mess if you don't.I used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup. Cut the recipe in 1/2 or you will have a ton of glaze. I used a spiral 17 lb. ham & still had glaze eventhough I cut the recipe in 1/2.. Can't go wrong with this recipe. Just use plenty of FOIL!!!!!!!We made this for Christmas.  Very good Turned out great!  We put the ham & glaze in an oven bag and just flipped the bag every 15-20min instead of basting.1/3 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey  baby carrots underneath , crock pot, lift lid and baste often, stud ham with clovesI'm not the biggest ham fan- but it was great!  It was a big holiday hit with my whole family. I added the juice from a can of pineapple rings to the sauce and then for the last 10 minutes of baking I garnished the ham with the pineapple rings.  Beautiful and tasty!!Loved, loved, loved this ham!!!!  First time I ever made a ham.(had to ask other shoppers what to buy...shank or butt? Shank won!)  Excellent recipe even though I used brown sugar instead of the syrup and omitted the cloves(hate cloves..yuk). Will definetly make this again!This make a great presentation ham, just like the picture.  Luckily the baste does make a lot because we could not reuse anything that cooked off because the honey separated under the aluminum foil and the butter remained on top (baked honey is a lot of fun to clean).   My husband and I have never made a ham before so we had to do some reasearch to what "score" means.  To score a ham means to cut diagonally at 1" intervals, cutting about 1/4" deep.  (score in opposite direction to make a diamond shape.) This made a great dinner ham but we didn't care for the flavor when used as leftovers for sandwiches.Came out great! I used an 8lb spiral cut ham. I used 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1 cup of honey and just a few cloves for the glaze based on previous reviews. I used most of it, but kept a little for the end.  I used an oven bag and flipped it over every 15-20 minutes to baste, it ended up breaking towards the end. At the end I took off the bag, brushed with a little more glaze I had not used, and put some brown sugar all over the ham, then broiled it on low for about 3 minutes for the crispy sugar layer the fancy pre-made hams come with. Watch the broiler it crisps fast. I followed the cooking instructions from the ham since it was precooked spiral cut, and cooked it on 275 for 10 minutes per lb to prevent drying out and it came out juicy and delicious. I served with cheesy potatoes and honey & brown sugar carrots cooked in the glaze.This is as close to the honey baked ham that I have found. The only thing that was missing was the crunchy topping so after I basted and cooked the ham, I put brown sugar on top and broiled it for about 2 to 3 minutes you just have to watch it so that it will not burn.Better than the famous honey baked ham at the store. I have some good tips! I used an ordinary Kirkland spiral ham from Costco...about 8 pounds. I think buying a spiral ham is key because all the glaze can get into the slices. I don't score it. I take the cold ham and pull the slices open, one at a time and pour the warm glaze into the meat.  I flip it over and do the same to the other side of the slices.  Then I put the ham meat side down on the pan and do another pour of the glaze over the whole ham.  I bake mine at 275 for 12 to 15 per pound.  I find that baking at this lower temperature makes it much more moist!  I do baste, but not as often as the recipe calls for-I'm too busy and I don't use a brush -just pour glaze on the ham w/ ladle. When the ham comes out, and as it rests a bit, I take a turkey baster and suck up all the hot ham juices/honey/sugar from the baking pan and start basting all the slices again as it cools!! It sucks up all the yumminess like you wouldn't believe. I carve it up and place the slices on a big plate and for good measure, pour a little bit of the pan juices over the slices. I found that the amount of glaze this recipe makes was enough for an 8 pound ham. I also used brown sugar instead of the corn syrup like the others mentioned.  I did't have whole cloves, so I put a tiny pinch of ground cloves in the sauce (but a very small pinch since it's strong). Didn't do double boiler, but kept on stove and heated it only as needed, mostly stove's off.My first attempt at a ham.  My kids were skeptical when I told them I was making a ham, as we're not big ham eaters.  I used a bone in spiral cut smoked ham from Costco, 9lbs. I used 2/3c butter, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4c brown sugar and 1c honey. Placed in crockpot for 6 hrs on low and basted every 30mins.  Added baby carrots after 3 hrs.  This glaze is AMAZING! The carrots were delicious and the ham was awesome!  My kids were happily suprised and I received many many compliments.  Will definitely make this for years to come!REALLY good glaze. The husband was so worried about me trying my own glaze instead of using a pre-glazed ham but one bite was all it took to calm his fears. I got a spiral cut ham and this made a delicious, light glaze that was wonderful on the outside but not so strong that it overpowered the meat. 
There is no need for foil in the pan. It cleans up much easier without the foil.Very good.  Tastes almost exactly like a purchased honey glazed ham.  I didn't bother with the entire amount of cloves as it would've taken me all day to insert them.  Still had good flavor and I didn't bother with turning on the broiler to carmelize.  Will make again.Excellent per other reviewers suggestions (omit cloves, sub brown sugar for corn syrup). Thanks :-)AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! This was just wonderful!! I bought a 2 pound ham because it was just me & my hubby, so I cut the recipe in half. I made exactly as the recipe called for except I used brown sugar in place of the corn syrup because I didn't have any on hand. Then I lined my pan really good with tin foil & put half the glaze in there while simmering the other half on the stove. I basted the ham often & when there was 10 min. left for the ham & half of the remaining glaze on the ham & then the rest of it when there was 5 min. left. There was a ton of glaze but it was sooo yummy that I didn't mind at all!! I served with mashed sweet potatoes, squash & honey wheat bread (from this site) The bread tasted soooo great dipped in the glaze!! My hubby loves ham & he thought this was absolutley great! I like ham but I don't usually have more than a piece or 2 & I thought it was the best ham I ever had period!!! I will be making this for christmas dinner when I have the family over! Awsome recipe, thanks soo much :)This was easy to do but not worth the time.  normally in our house ham is devoured but with this glaze no one even came back for seconds.  It was to bitter and to butter.  It was not the sweet honey taste I thought it would have.Too much butter and honey! It was not a pleasent smell or taste. I did not alter the recipe. I would suggest less butter, honey, no cloves, and using light brown sugar in sub for the syrup. The strange sweet flavor over powered this ham! If you have a presliced ham bake with a foil cover or yours will dry out too. I have never made a ham before and this came out perfect!  My hubby said it was the best ham he's ever eaten!  :)  I followed "Mazzo"'s review and used 1/3 C butter, 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/4 C honey for the glaze.  I also put some sliced carrots in the baking pan with the ham so they got some of that honey-sugary flavor too.  I don't even really like carrots but I ate them all.  YUM!!!!

As another poster suggested - Vernors Ginger Ale is best but I think it's a Michigan-based pop.  Didn't have it in IL.  But if you can find it - it's awesome.  Great for reheating leftover ham.....gently simmer in the Vernors - easy ham and great tasting.Very good and very easy to prepare. Perfect for holiday dinners. Made it for Easter and I'll be making it again for Christmas!My Father had made this every Easter for years.  Also excellent is using a bone-in Ham and basting every 20 minutes until finished.  We live in the Philadelphia area and our favorites were Franks Golden ginger ale.  2 generations love this recepie.I make ham in a similar way and this is very yummy- I let the ham bake a little longer and mix the ginger ale/pineapple juice basting juices and drippings with a can of cream of mushroom soup for a wonderful gravy.I made this for Christmas and it was very good. I combined the brown sugar, pineapple juice and ginger ale before pouring over the ham and basted every 30 minutes. I also used a butt portion ham and Bleinheim's Ginger Ale. Will be using this again at Easter. I wonder how it would work on the grill and use the juice mixture as a basting sauce?My kids didn't like the pineapple, but did like the ham!  It was good the next day for ham sandwiches.This is really good.  A suggestion--If you can get Vernor's Ginger Ale, use that.  Oh my! what a flavor.  A glaze of the ingredients that another reviewer wrote would be perfect.Excellent recipe.  Made this dish twice and it was great both times.  Such a simple and easy recipe.This was good and easy.

I combined the brown sugar, pineapple juice and ginger ale before pouring over the ham and basted every 30 minutes. I also used a butt portion ham and Bleinheim's Ginger Ale. Will be using this again at Easter. I wonder how it would work on the grill and use the juice mixture as a basting sauce?My kids didn't like the pineapple, but did like the ham!  It was good the next day for ham sandwiches.This is really good.  A suggestion--If you can get Vernor's Ginger Ale, use that.  Oh my! what a flavor.  A glaze of the ingredients that another reviewer wrote would be perfect.Excellent recipe.  Made this dish twice and it was great both times.  Such a simple and easy recipe.This was good and easy.  BUT, next time, I will make a syrup of the brown sugar/pineapple juice/ginger ale before pouring it over.  It was sweet, but it would have been better if it was more of a glaze.I've been making ham like this for years.  As another poster suggested - Vernors Ginger Ale is best but I think it's a Michigan-based pop.  Didn't have it in IL.  But if you can find it - it's awesome.  Great for reheating leftover ham.....gently simmer in the Vernors - easy ham and great tasting.Very good and very easy to prepare. Perfect for holiday dinners.

A glaze of the ingredients that another reviewer wrote would be perfect.Excellent recipe.  Made this dish twice and it was great both times.  Such a simple and easy recipe.I have gone through a lot of ham and bean soup recipes in 40 years and found this one to be my favorite. It's so simple that the only thing needed on my grocery list was ham hocks.  Be sure to purchase meaty ones, and don't add additional salt, it's plenty salty with the ham hocks.  The only change I made was to strain the soup after cooking, chill the liquid, skim off the fat then add the liquid back to the rest of the ingredients.  My husband loved it and that's the clincher.This soup turned out so delicious, I would rate it as the best soup I've ever made. I did not have dried beans so I used a can of white beans, a can of black beans and a can of red kidney beans. I rinsed them thoroughly as I did not want to add any extra salt. No "real" garlic on hand, so used lots of garlic powder. Threw everything in slow cooker with 6 cups of water and dissolved chicken bouillon in the remaining 2 cups of water. Cooked on high for 8-9 hrs. Fabulous!  Everyone raved about it, will definitely make again.I was looking for a soup to use up a ham bone left from Easter Sunday, and this was perfect! It's similar to the way I usually make my bean soup, except this one has garlic and thyme. I did cut the celery back a bit, as I only had 2-1/2 stalks in the frig. A good hearty soup that we all enjoyed.I really liked the flavor of this bean soup! I followed it pretty much to the T.  I did replace water with chicken stock for more flavor and added a bit more salt and pepper. I would make it again.Really quite good, filling, and healthy.The basic recipe is good but my soup lacked a smoky ham taste so I added one package of Goya ham flavoring (I know it has a high sodium count) and the soup became flavorful and my family loved it.  Even better the next day.  I will make again when I have a ham bone left over to provide more meat and richer flavor.I'm not a huge fan of bean soups but decided to make some to use up a ham bone I had. It was excellent even though I didn't have a bay leaf. Simple recipes are the best.This soup is so darned good.  My Aunt Dee has been making this for many years and she finally gave me her secret recipe and it is pretty much this very recipe.  But Aunt Dee is known for some shortcuts, so I tried both and as much as I want to insist that there is a difference, there is not.  Aunt Dee's "beloved" recipe is made with these same ingredients though from jars and cans.  Yep, I'm not proud. If you're so inclined to "take the easy path", this is it.  A 48oz jar of Randall's beans (mixed or Northern),  15oz can sliced carrots and the juice, 15oz can diced potatoes and the juice, 2-3 stalks diced celery,  3/4-1 cup diced onion, garlic or garlic powder to taste, 1/2t thyme to taste, pepper to taste, a bayleaf,  24 oz water, a big meaty hambone or hamhocks, and maybe even a handful or two of any diced ham that you may have in the meat drawer.  To make myself feel better about this cheating way of making soup, my addition was to add 3 or 4 handfuls of chopped kale (center ribs removed) and saute it in EVOO along with the celery and onions.  It made me feel better about myself.  Again, this soup is so darned good.GreatI have gone through a lot of ham and bean soup recipes in 40 years and found this one to be my favorite.

I would make it again.Really quite good, filling, and healthy.The basic recipe is good but my soup lacked a smoky ham taste so I added one package of Goya ham flavoring (I know it has a high sodium count) and the soup became flavorful and my family loved it.  Even better the next day.  I will make again when I have a ham bone left over to provide more meat and richer flavor.I'm not a huge fan of bean soups but decided to make some to use up a ham bone I had. It was excellent even though I didn't have a bay leaf. Simple recipes are the best.This soup is so darned good.  My Aunt Dee has been making this for many years and she finally gave me her secret recipe and it is pretty much this very recipe.  But Aunt Dee is known for some shortcuts, so I tried both and as much as I want to insist that there is a difference, there is not.  Aunt Dee's "beloved" recipe is made with these same ingredients though from jars and cans.  Yep, I'm not proud. If you're so inclined to "take the easy path", this is it.  A 48oz jar of Randall's beans (mixed or Northern),  15oz can sliced carrots and the juice, 15oz can diced potatoes and the juice, 2-3 stalks diced celery,  3/4-1 cup diced onion, garlic or garlic powder to taste, 1/2t thyme to taste, pepper to taste, a bayleaf,  24 oz water, a big meaty hambone or hamhocks, and maybe even a handful or two of any diced ham that you may have in the meat drawer.  To make myself feel better about this cheating way of making soup, my addition was to add 3 or 4 handfuls of chopped kale (center ribs removed) and saute it in EVOO along with the celery and onions.  It made me feel better about myself.  Again, this soup is so darned good.GreatI have gone through a lot of ham and bean soup recipes in 40 years and found this one to be my favorite. It's so simple that the only thing needed on my grocery list was ham hocks.  Be sure to purchase meaty ones, and don't add additional salt, it's plenty salty with the ham hocks.  The only change I made was to strain the soup after cooking, chill the liquid, skim off the fat then add the liquid back to the rest of the ingredients.  My husband loved it and that's the clincher.This soup turned out so delicious, I would rate it as the best soup I've ever made. I did not have dried beans so I used a can of white beans, a can of black beans and a can of red kidney beans. I rinsed them thoroughly as I did not want to add any extra salt. No "real" garlic on hand, so used lots of garlic powder. Threw everything in slow cooker with 6 cups of water and dissolved chicken bouillon in the remaining 2 cups of water. Cooked on high for 8-9 hrs. Fabulous!  Everyone raved about it, will definitely make again.I was looking for a soup to use up a ham bone left from Easter Sunday, and this was perfect! It's similar to the way I usually make my bean soup, except this one has garlic and thyme. I did cut the celery back a bit, as I only had 2-1/2 stalks in the frig.

It's not necessary as there's already plenty of it in the ham. Too much salt can surely ruin a perfectly good dish and without it, this salad is very tasty and worth making for lunch with your leftovers.AWESOME! At first, I thought it was just okay and decided to "doctor it up" in the morning...make this the night before, and let it set in the fridge overnite...Big Difference! I used half sweet pickles and half dill (couldn't decide!), and I also ground it up in the food processor. Our local deli's is very good, but this was so much better...thanks James!I am not a cook....whoo...that is a understatement. I whipped this up from some left over ham and my husband went crazy over it. We did add some hard boiled eggs to this recipe and we were delighted at how wonderful everything blended together for a fantastic taste.I made this ham salad for finger sandwiches for a special function.  I also made egg salad and tuna salad.  The ham salad sandwiches went the fastest.  Everybody raved about the taste.  I highly recommend this recipe.I found this recipe to be very easy to make.  However, it is extremely salty.  I would not recommend the use of additional salt.   I wish that I had noticed the sodium content prior to making the recipe.  I ruined a good ham.  I would attempt to make this again, only no smoked ham and no extra salt.I used miracle whip in place of the mayo and left out the celery since I didn't have any and it was still great.  Oh, and I only put in a pinch of salt. I can't wait to try it with the celery.This salad was easy and had a great taste!!!  I used half mayo, half Miracle Whip, and used dill relish instead of sweet relish.  I don't normally like ham salad, but this was good!!!  I also left out the salt as suggested in another review.I am not a huge ham fan and found this recipe ideal for after-the-Holidays leftover ham.  I added some spicy mustard for a bit of added flavor.  I also chopped the ham and veggies in the food processor for a nice small consistency.Like the recipe says,Great on crackers or bread!
I am the only ham lover in family,until hubby and son tried it. Very good!Holy cow, if anyone out there has high blood pressure, PLEASE leave out the salt!! It's not necessary as there's already plenty of it in the ham. Too much salt can surely ruin a perfectly good dish and without it, this salad is very tasty and worth making for lunch with your leftovers.AWESOME!

I am the only ham lover in family,until hubby and son tried it. Very good!So simple yet so very good!  I made this for our Easter dinner today, and it was delicious!  Because I needed my oven for other cooking projects, I put my precooked spiral ham in the crockpot, set it on low, and three hours later had a ham that was just-right sweet, tender, juicy.  The juice that collected made the best ham gravy; all I had to do was put it in a sauce pan, make a slurry of cornstarch and water, added it to the juices and cooked until thickened.  No other season required.  Perfect! This will be the way I make baked ham from now on.My ham was smaller, but I went ahead & used the full amount of glaze. We loved the flavor, and my ham was tender & juicy & the glaze was a sweet & tangy complement to the ham. I used 2 teaspoons regular mustard in place of the dry mustard.Great recipe Roz21, and I will definitely use it again!This was very good coating for ham.  I like the idea of wrapping the ham in foil with the glaze while it cooks.  I just added all of the glaze at the beginning and didn't unwrap it towards the end.  This might also be good using pineapple preserves.Exceptional!!  I myself am not a huge ham fan~ this one I am!  I used a regular bone in ham, not a spiral cut.  I also decided to use my crock pot.  I put a small bit (about 5 oz) of soda (I used  Diet Sierra Mist) so it would not cook to the bottom.  I poked the ham all over and would from time to time using a baster, put the juice into the ham.  I used more than what was called for as far as the apricot jam (preserves)~ probably close to doubled it.  I also added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of honey and about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves.  I cooked it on high for about four hours, but it was done before that (but did not dry out at all).  My entire family loved it, my kids too~ dad even jumped online to get the recipe so he could save it!It seems to be my job to cook hams during the holidays. I tried this one at Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. I used a huge 26 pound ham, so I had to use a little more. I also used my old reliable charcoal grill instead of baking the ham. My family will see to it that I make this ham again.This ham was great. Everybody loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  The ham gravy was delicious--I added extra apricot jam to the juice to really bring out the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.Best way to glaze and cook the ham. Used spicy brown mustard instead of dry.This was the best ham ever!!!  I've been looking for a ham recipe and FINALLY found one!  I used a spiral cut ham, put most of the glaze on, wrapped my ham in foil and popped it in the oven.  About 1/2 hour before serving, I added the remaining glaze.  Everyone was amazed at the flavor yet it was soooo easy.  I used the recipe as is.  Don't change a thing.  This recipe is a winner!!That was yummySo simple yet so very good!

My entire family loved it, my kids too~ dad even jumped online to get the recipe so he could save it!It seems to be my job to cook hams during the holidays. I tried this one at Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. I used a huge 26 pound ham, so I had to use a little more. I also used my old reliable charcoal grill instead of baking the ham. My family will see to it that I make this ham again.This ham was great. Everybody loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  The ham gravy was delicious--I added extra apricot jam to the juice to really bring out the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.Best way to glaze and cook the ham. Used spicy brown mustard instead of dry.This was the best ham ever!!!  I've been looking for a ham recipe and FINALLY found one!  I used a spiral cut ham, put most of the glaze on, wrapped my ham in foil and popped it in the oven.  About 1/2 hour before serving, I added the remaining glaze.  Everyone was amazed at the flavor yet it was soooo easy.  I used the recipe as is.  Don't change a thing.  This recipe is a winner!!That was yummySo simple yet so very good!  I made this for our Easter dinner today, and it was delicious!  Because I needed my oven for other cooking projects, I put my precooked spiral ham in the crockpot, set it on low, and three hours later had a ham that was just-right sweet, tender, juicy.  The juice that collected made the best ham gravy; all I had to do was put it in a sauce pan, make a slurry of cornstarch and water, added it to the juices and cooked until thickened.  No other season required.  Perfect! This will be the way I make baked ham from now on.My ham was smaller, but I went ahead & used the full amount of glaze. We loved the flavor, and my ham was tender & juicy & the glaze was a sweet & tangy complement to the ham. I used 2 teaspoons regular mustard in place of the dry mustard.Great recipe Roz21, and I will definitely use it again!This was very good coating for ham.  I like the idea of wrapping the ham in foil with the glaze while it cooks.  I just added all of the glaze at the beginning and didn't unwrap it towards the end.  This might also be good using pineapple preserves.Exceptional!!  I myself am not a huge ham fan~ this one I am!  I used a regular bone in ham, not a spiral cut.  I also decided to use my crock pot.  I put a small bit (about 5 oz) of soda (I used  Diet Sierra Mist) so it would not cook to the bottom.  I poked the ham all over and would from time to time using a baster, put the juice into the ham.  I used more than what was called for as far as the apricot jam (preserves)~ probably close to doubled it.  I also added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of honey and about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves.  I cooked it on high for about four hours, but it was done before that (but did not dry out at all).
